# LossyAD

Combining **[TSB_AD](https://github.com/TheDatumOrg/TSB-AD)** with **[TerseTS](https://github.com/cmcuza/TerseTS)**

You can download the univariate datasets here,
* TSB-AD-U: https://www.thedatum.org/datasets/TSB-AD-U.zip
After downloading put the TSB-AD-U directory in the Datasets folder

Usage:
pip install -r requirements.txt
To run use python -m TSB_AD.main

Between each usage if you want to re run experiments delete the eval directory

# LossyAD

## ðŸ”— Datasets

You can download the univariate time series anomaly datasets from the [TSB-AD-U](https://www.thedatum.org/datasets/TSB-AD-U.zip) collection.

**Instructions:**
1. Download the ZIP file from the link above.
2. Extract the contents.
3. Place the `TSB-AD-U` directory inside the `Datasets/` folder.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation
